# Setup

## Create Virtual Environment

In a terminal run the following commands from the root folder of the forked project.

```
python -m venv venv
```

Once that completes, also run this command from the same folder.

Windows

```
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

macOS & Linux

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

Now that you are working in the virtualenv, install the project dependencies with the following command.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Verify Setup

In order to verify that everything is setup correctly, run the following command, which should show you the failing tests. This is good! Weâ€™ll be fixing this test once we jump into the build step.

```
pytest
```

Every time you want to check your work locally you can type that command, and it will report the status of every task in the project.

# Working on tasks
## Task 1: Importing Numpy Library
**`@pytest.mark.test_task1`** In order to start working with the project, load the `numpy` library with an alias `np` at the top of the `tasks/solution.py` file.

## Task 2: Importing the text score file 
**`@pytest.mark.test_task2`** This test to check that the text score file `score.txt` from the `data` directory has been correctly loaded into np dataframe variable using the `np.genfromtxt()` method.

## Task 3: Finding the Max value of the scores
**`@pytest.mark.test_task3`** To find the maximum score use the function .max() from the np library.

## Task 4: Finding the Min value of the scores
**`@pytest.mark.test_task4`** To find the maximum score use the function .min() from the np library.
